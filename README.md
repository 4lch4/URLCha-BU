# URLCha

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/HF-Solutions/URLCha.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

**URLCha** is a simple URL shortening service, created by Alcha of HassleFree Solutions, LLC.

Just visit the index page of the frontend, provide a URL to shorten and click Submit or press Enter. The shortened URL is generated entirely on the client side, and then sent to the backend for storage. The shortened URL then appears on the page with an easy copy to clipboard option using JS.

The project is still heavily a Work in Progress. The frontend and backend were designed completely separately and need to be tied together to work properly. I would like the URL's and everything to actually be generated on the server side and then the resulting URL passed back to be displayed.
